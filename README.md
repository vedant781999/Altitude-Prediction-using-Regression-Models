# Altitude-Prediction-using-Regression-Models
Altitude of a place is predicted from its latitude and longitude using regression models with regularization.

A dataset of more than 3 Lakh places were taken from which 70% of that was used to train the model and the rest 30% was used for testing.

Regression Analysis is used by taking and training models with polynomials of various degrees with regularization to avoid overfitting of the training data.

The model is developed in Python language using numpy and pandas packages to simplify data visualization and training.

Polynomial models of upto 6 degrees were trained and tested and the results were analyzed to come up with the best possible model.
